# magic-lamp
[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/magic-lamp)](https://pypi.org/project/magic-lamp/)

Create magic LLM-powered Python functions that return whatever you ask. Downloads and uses a local LLM.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install magic-lamp
```

Define a function with a description and a set of examples.

```python
import magic_lamp

get_atoms = magic_lamp.Function(
    "Break this molecule down into it's constituent atoms. Return as a set.",
    examples=[
        ("water", {"hydrogen", "oxygen"}),
        ("glucose", {"carbon", "hydrogen", "oxygen"}),
    ],
)

print(get_atoms("ammonia")) # => {"nitrogen", "hydrogen"}
```

Functions can return any Python literal.

## Configuring the LLM

By default, `magic-lamp` downloads and runs a local LLM from Hugging Face. For more complex tasks, OpenAI models will perform better.

### Using OpenAI

`OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. Pass in the name of a `gpt-*` model to the function constructor.

```python
import magic_lamp


format_number = magic_lamp.Function(
    'Write this number out in words.',
    examples=[
        (1, "one"),
        (35, "thirty-five"),
        (15690, "fifteen thousand, six hundred ninety"),
    ],
    model="gpt-4o-mini"
)

print(format_number(328745226793))
```
